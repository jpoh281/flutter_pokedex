## Architecture

This project was made with <b>BLoC architecture</b>, working with repositories and data providers, as suggested by them (https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture)

Dependencies are injected using <b>GetIt</b>.
  
All models are serialized by <b>json_serializable</b> and generated by <b>build_runner</b>

## Project structure

> - /lib
>   - /bloc
>   - /data
>     - /data_providers
>     - /models
>     - /repositories
>   - /presentation
>     - /common
>     - /screens
>     - /pages
>     - /widgets

This architecture is great for Mobile application development in Flutter, is NOT expected to be escalable to web, or other mobile development frameworks. If in the future we needed to escale to web, we just need to create abstract classes to connect repositories and data_providers, as well as raw entities.

## TODO

### Architecture improvements:
- Create small cubits to retrieve parts of the Pokémon data, such as Evolution Chain, Abilities, Stats, instead of loading all at once into PokemonWrapper.

### Other improvements:
- Retrieve Pokémon sprites and improve UX for Evolution section in Pokemon Details screen.
- Retrieve more information and improve UX for Moves section in Pokemon Details screen.
- Create pagination for Pokémon list.

## API

This project uses the PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) as data provider.
